Diet Plan Web Application Proposal
Overview
What is the problem we are trying to solve?
Many individuals struggle with planning balanced and personalized diets based on their age, weight, height, activity level, etc. Also, we need to consider the overwhelming amount of nutritional information online that can make it difficult to create structured meal plans that are practical.
Why are we doing this?
Main purpose is to simplify the diet planning process by creating a web application that generates personalized diet plans. This solution will use external API data to offer accurate nutrition advice and help promote healthier eating habits. By automating diet plan creation, it saves users time, clears up confusion, and makes it easier for them to reach their health goals.
Who is the audience?
Nutritionists and dietitians looking for a tool to assist their clients.
People dealing with specific health conditions, like diabetes or obesity, who need customized meal plans.
Users seeking to improve their dietary habits.
Fitness enthusiasts looking for diet plans tailored to their specific goals.
Major Functions of the Application
User Profile Setup
Users provide their health details, including age, weight, height, activity level, dietary preferences (such as vegan or gluten-free), and specific objectives like losing weight or building muscle.
Personalized Diet Plan
Using the userâ€™s information, the application determines their calorie and macronutrient requirements and creates customized meal plans for individual days or entire weeks.
Nutritional Information Integration
Show detailed nutrition facts for each meal or food item, including calories, proteins, fats, carbs, and essential vitamins and minerals.
Food Database Search
Let users search and explore different foods, complete with nutrition details and information on whether they fit their dietary preferences.
Progress Tracking
Users can log their meals, keep track of their calorie intake, and monitor their progress toward achieving their health goals.
